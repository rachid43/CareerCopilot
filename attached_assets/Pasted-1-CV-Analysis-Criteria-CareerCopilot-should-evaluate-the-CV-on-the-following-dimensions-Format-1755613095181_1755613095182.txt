1. CV Analysis Criteria
CareerCopilot should evaluate the CV on the following dimensions:

📄 Format & Presentation
Clarity: Logical structure, clean layout, and readable fonts.

Length: Ideally 1 page (entry-level) to 2 pages (experienced).

Consistency: Uniform formatting (dates, titles, bullets).

Section hierarchy: Clear headings like Summary, Experience, Education, Skills.

🎯 Relevance
Tailoring: Evidence of alignment with industry or target roles.

Keywords: Presence of job-specific terms and action verbs.

Quantifiable impact: Metrics and achievements, not just duties.

💼 Experience Section
Reverse-chronological order.

Clear job titles and employers.

Bullet points with action-result structure (e.g., Improved X by Y% through Z).

🧠 Skills & Competencies
Technical and soft skills listed clearly.

Avoids buzzwords without proof (e.g., "team player").

🧑‍🎓 Education & Certifications
Relevant degrees or training for the job.

Date and institution clarity.

🛠️ Optional but Valuable
Projects, languages, volunteer experience, links to portfolio/GitHub/LinkedIn.

✅ 2. Cover Letter: General Standard
When reviewing a cover letter without a job description, CareerCopilot should assess:

✍️ Structure
Header with contact info and date.

Greeting personalized if possible (avoid “To Whom It May Concern”).

💬 Tone & Language
Professional, confident, and polite.

Avoids clichés and generic phrases.

Active voice and strong verbs.

📣 Content Quality
Summarizes unique value proposition.

Shows interest in the company/industry, not just the job.

Avoids restating the CV — adds narrative or examples instead.

✅ 3. Cover Letter: Alignment with Job Description
When a user uploads a job description, CareerCopilot should additionally assess:

🔍 Tailoring & Relevance
Mentions company name, role title, and specific job requirements.

References exact qualifications or responsibilities from the job ad.
